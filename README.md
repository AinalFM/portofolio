Comparing the performance of pre-trained models EfficientNet and SqueezeNet in developing a classification model to detect early-stage Alzheimer's. Each model underwent the deployment process using FastAPI. Additionally, the SMOTE-ENN technique is also applied to address the imbalanced dataset condition found in the MRI image data used.
